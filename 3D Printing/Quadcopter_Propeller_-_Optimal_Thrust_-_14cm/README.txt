# Summary

This remix features improved performance on the original design (thing:30284) by Landru.   Thing 30284 is an awesome design with a pretty clever approach to printing orientation for optimal durability, but unfortunately it fails to provide sufficient lift for my drone. Thus, this remix.

Note: These blades were designed to fit Sky Viper quadcopters such as v950hd. Once I move on to something more "grown up" (possibly print the Crossfire 2 by MikeyB, thing:234867), I'll upload the revised designs.

It's preferred that after 3D-printing is complete the blades hang out in an acetone vapor bath for about 30 minutes (40 max), followed by a 3-4 hour cure period. This process fuses the layers which makes them a little more durable and improves aerodynamics. And as a bonus feature it gives them a nice glossy finish.

After the printing and finishing is done with the above mentioned parameters, the props turn out to be 14cm in diameter and weigh 2.54 grams (0.5 grams heavier than the stock props). It took me about 2 hours to print a set of four blades.

While not as good as the stock blades, with additional tweaking they should perform almost as good. The video of them in action is also here: https://youtu.be/MT1IOt7kbHA

Have fun, and always remember to exercise extreme caution when operating unmanned areal vehicles near humans, pets, and other people's private property. 

Thanks!

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.17mm
Infill: 0.3

Notes: 
Printing the attached STL file will get you a pair of "A" blades. To get a set of the "B" blades I simply set my object's Y-axis scale from "1" to a "-1" before slicing it. Also, don't worry about the support material, as I've already included it in the STL's mesh. 

You can set your slicer to whatever settings you prefer, however, I've had most success printing it in ABS plastic from a 0.40mm nozzle at 0.17mm layer height, 30% infill, and a 2-layer shell. My printer's extruder and hotbed temperatures were set at 215 and 112 degrees Celsius. I used a Solidoodle 3 device and its default software Repetier Host.
